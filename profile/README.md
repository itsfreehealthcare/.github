# It's Free Health Care
## an upcoming organisation working towards creating a free and open source healthcare. 

This is our way as developers to give back to the community. While government too provides free healthcare options they are not easily scalable and very difficult to approach for people

As developers we like to solve problems at scale or atleast solve a problem and then take it to scale. 

## The goal is simple and the vision is really big

We are working towards getting people free access to healthcare, this is MASSIVE and probably not possible right now for us to do this independently, so we seek your contribution on helping us build this, be part of the process, contribute in any sense you wish to.
